## What is Coinjoin

The signatures, one per input, inside a transaction are completely independent of each other. This means that it's 
possible for Bitcoin users to agree on a set of inputs to spend, and a set of outputs to pay to, and then to individually 
and separately sign a transaction and later merge their signatures. The transaction is not valid and won't be accepted 
by the network until all signatures are provided, and no one will sign a transaction which is not to their liking.

To use this to increase privacy, the N users would agree on a uniform output size and provide inputs amounting to at 
least that size. The transaction would have N outputs of that size and potentially N more change outputs if some of the 
users provided input in excess of the target. All would sign the transaction, and then the transaction could be transmitted. 
No risk of theft at any point.

Consider the following transactions made at the same time: A purchases an item from B, C purchases an item from D, and E 
purchases an item from F. Without Coinjoin, the public blockchain ledger would record three separate transactions for 
each input-output match. With Coinjoin, only one single transaction is recorded. The ledger would show that bitcoins 
were paid from A, C, and E addresses to B, D, and F. By masking the deals made by all parties, an observer canâ€™t, with 
full certainty, determine who sent bitcoins to whom.

## What we will do

Let's create a Coinjoin transaction mixing four different transactions. 

We will do the following: 
  * Alice_0    -> Bob_0
  * Carol_0    -> Dave_0
  * Eve_0      -> Mallory_0
  * Mallory_1  -> Alice_1 

The four signatories agree on a uniform output amount of 0.2 BTC.  

We will create four UTXOs to spend from, with different amounts but with at least 0.2 BTC. If someone spend a UTXO that
is more than 0.2 BTC, we will create a additional output for his change. 


## Create UTXOs to spend from

First we need to create four previous transactions in order to have the UTXOs at our disposal.

Import libraries, test wallets and set the network
```javascript
const bitcoin = require('bitcoinjs-lib')
const { alice, bob, carol, dave, eve, mallory } = require('./wallets.json')
const network = bitcoin.networks.regtest
```

Send 0.2 BTC to Alice_0 P2PKH address. 
Send 0.2 BTC to Carol_0 P2PKH address. 
Send 0.25 BTC to Eve_0 P2PKH address. 
Send 0.3 BTC to Mallory_1 P2PKH address. 
> Check out **_[02_0: Generating and Importing Wallets](02_0_Generating_and_Importing_Wallets.md)_** and your `wallets.json`
> file in the `code` directory. Replace the address if necessary.
```
$ sendtoaddress n4SvybJicv79X1Uc4o3fYXWGwXadA53FSq 0.2
$ sendtoaddress mh1HAVWhKkzcvF41MNRKfakVvPV2sfaf3R 0.2
$ sendtoaddress mqbYBESF4bib4VTmsqe6twxMDKtVpeeJpt 0.25
$ sendtoaddress mxHHs4fNt1mBh4gz5MWegw4KYbGwPLXSUk 0.3
```

Get the output indexes of the four transactions, so that we have their outpoint (txid / vout).
> Find the output index (or vout) under `details > vout`.
```
$ gettransaction "txid"
$ gettransaction "txid"
$ gettransaction "txid"
$ gettransaction "txid"
```  


## Creating the Coinjoin transaction

Now let's spend the UTXOs and create new ones.
A facilitator, let's say Alice_0, will create the transaction, sign his input, then pass the partially-signed transaction 
to the next participant and so on until everybody has signed and someone broadcast it.

Create a key pair for each spender (Alice_0, Carol_0, Eve_0, Mallory_1), so that they can sign. 
```javascript
const keyPairAlice0 = bitcoin.ECPair.fromWIF(alice[0].wif, network)
const keyPairCarol0 = bitcoin.ECPair.fromWIF(carol[0].wif, network)
const keyPairEve0 = bitcoin.ECPair.fromWIF(eve[0].wif, network)
const keyPairMallory1 = bitcoin.ECPair.fromWIF(mallory[1].wif, network)
```

Create an address for each recipient (Bob_0, Dave_0, Mallory_0, Alice_1), so that they can receive. 
```javascript
const keyPairBob0 = bitcoin.ECPair.fromWIF(bob[0].wif, network)
const p2pkhBob0 = bitcoin.payments.p2pkh({pubkey: keyPairBob0.publicKey, network})

const keyPairDave0 = bitcoin.ECPair.fromWIF(dave[0].wif, network)
const p2pkhDave0 = bitcoin.payments.p2pkh({pubkey: keyPairDave0.publicKey, network})

const keyPairMallory0 = bitcoin.ECPair.fromWIF(mallory[0].wif, network)
const p2pkhMallory0 = bitcoin.payments.p2pkh({pubkey: keyPairMallory0.publicKey, network})

const keyPairAlice1 = bitcoin.ECPair.fromWIF(alice[1].wif, network)
const p2pkhAlice1 = bitcoin.payments.p2pkh({pubkey: keyPairAlice1.publicKey, network})
```

We also have two more recipients that will get back their change (Eve_0 and Mallory_1).
```javascript
const p2pkhEve0 = bitcoin.payments.p2pkh({pubkey: keyPairEve0.publicKey, network})
const p2pkhMallory1 = bitcoin.payments.p2pkh({pubkey: keyPairMallory1.publicKey, network})
```

Create a BitcoinJS transaction builder object.
```javascript
const txb = new bitcoin.TransactionBuilder(network)
```

Add each inputs by providing the outpoints.
```javascript
txb.addInput('TX_ID', TX_VOUT)
txb.addInput('TX_ID', TX_VOUT)
txb.addInput('TX_ID', TX_VOUT)
txb.addInput('TX_ID', TX_VOUT)
```

Add each 0.2 BTC payment outputs.
```javascript
txb.addOutput(p2pkhBob0.address, 2e7)
txb.addOutput(p2pkhDave0.address, 2e7)
txb.addOutput(p2pkhMallory0.address, 2e7)
txb.addOutput(p2pkhAlice1.address, 2e7)
```

Add the change outputs of Eve_0 and Mallory_1. These UTXOs will not be coinjoined. One might reasonably assume that the
4950000 satoshis UTXO belongs to Eve_0 and that the 9950000 satoshis UTXO belongs to Mallory_1. 
Let's also subtract the mining fees (0.0005 BTC each) from them.
We can have different policies regarding who has to pay for the mining fees, it is just easier that way for our example.
```javascript
txb.addOutput(p2pkhEve0.address, 5e6 - 5e4)
txb.addOutput(p2pkhMallory1.address, 1e7 - 5e4)
```

> The miner fee is calculated by subtracting the outputs from the inputs.
> (20000000 + 20000000 + 25000000 + 30000000)ins - (20000000 + 20000000 + 20000000 + 20000000 + 4950000 + 9950000)outs
> = 100 000
> 100 000 satoshis equals 0,001 BTC, this is the mining fee.

Each participant signs their input with the default `SIGHASH_ALL` flag, which prevents inputs or outputs from being 
manipulated after the fact.
```javascript
txb.sign(0, keyPairAlice0)
txb.sign(1, keyPairCarol0)
txb.sign(2, keyPairEve0)
txb.sign(3, keyPairMallory1)
```

Finally we can build the transaction and get the raw hex serialization.
```javascript
const tx = txb.build()
console.log('tx.toHex()  ', tx.toHex())
```

Inspect the raw transaction with Bitcoin Core CLI, check that everything is correct.
```
$ decoderawtransaction "hexstring"
```


## Broadcasting the transaction

It's time to broadcast the transaction via Bitcoin Core CLI.
```
$ sendrawtransaction "hexstring"
```

Inspect the transaction.
> Don't forget the second argument to returns a detailed json object.
```
$ getrawtransaction "txid" true
```
